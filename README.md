## Overview
CodeSwarm is an Open Source [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) and [Continuous Deployment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment)
system built with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [Docker](http://docker.io/).  CodeSwarm is built with plugins, providing tremendous flexibility.

### Vagrant



### System

CodeSwarm has been tested on the following systems:

* Ubuntu Precise 12.04 (LTS) (64-bit)
* Mac OSX 10.8.5

CodeSwarm was built to work on POSIX systems, including most Unix and Linux variants that support Node.js.

### Dependencies

CodeSwarm consists of a single Node.JS Web Application process, which spawns test jobs in response to source code commits and manual test runs.

* **Required**
	* Node.JS
	* A CouchDB database backend
* **Optional**
	* Docker

### Setup

CodeSwarm can be cloned from Github and installed then its dependencies can be installed via `npm`.

You can download and install using the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:codeswarm/codeswarm.git
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

CodeSwarm runs on port 1337 by default.  After starting the CodeSwarm process you can navigate to http://localhost:1337 to create an account and get started.

**Github Authentication**
You will also need a GitHub Client ID and Secret:

* Register a new application https://github.com/settings/applications
* Set the homepage URL to http://$YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/
* Set the callback URL to http://$YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/auth/github/callback
* Save the ClientID and Secret for assigning to Environment Variables, defined below

**CouchDB Setup**

* Assuming you have CouchDB [installed](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installing_on_OSX) and configured ...
* Copy your CouchDB URL and username and password for setup below

### Environment Variables

CodeSwarm utilizes Environment variables for configuration.  

* PORT - Public port CodeSwarm runs on, defaults to 1337
* COUCHDB_URL - CouchDB URL, defaults to 'http://localhost:5984'
* COUCHDB_USERNAME - CouchDB Username, defaults to 'admin'
* COUCHDB_PASSWORD - CouchDB Password, defaults to 'admin'
* GITHUB_CLIENT_ID - Github Client ID, defaults to an application set up for local development
* GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET - Github Client Secret, defaults to an application set up for local development
* GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL - Github Client Callback Url, defaults to http://localhost:1337/auth/github/callback

You can set these variables on the command line prior to calling NPM start.  Here's a quick example:

```sh
$ PORT=1337 COUCHDB_URL=http://localhost:5984 COUCHDB_USERNAME=admin COUCHDB_PASSWORD=admin npm run start
```
